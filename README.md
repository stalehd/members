Membership management software

Required components:
* reportlab (in reportlab/)
* cloudstorage (in cloudstorage/)

Simple memebership management software for small to medium sized clubs. This is tailored to the Norwegian Alfa Romeo Owner's Club, all in Norwegian and probably not very useful for other clubs... yet. 

Runs on Google App Engine; for a small club with < 1500 members you won't see a lot of charges. The 
current bill from Google have been hovering around $0.01 each month.

Not a lot of features but the major parts are there: Signups with notifications to interested parties, self service for members (needs separate distribution of secret maintenance code) and reports for magazine distributions.
